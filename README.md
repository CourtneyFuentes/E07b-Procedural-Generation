# E07b-Procedural-Generation

Exercise 7b for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington. I play with a TileMap node and to see how procedural generation might work in a project.

This exercise is taken from the [Procedural Content Generation in Godot Part 1: Mazes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShYWaGF3Nc) from KidsCanCode.
